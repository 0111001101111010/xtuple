PLEASE SEE THE README FOR BLOSSOM SETUP.

To set up Vows.js testing, you need to install Node 0.6.5 or higher:

    http://nodejs.org/

This automatically includes npm, the Node Package Manager.

Next, install the following Node packages:

    sudo npm install -g vows jsdom xmlhttprequest

Vows.js tests are in the tests/ folder. Take a look at tests/example.js for 
how to code a Vows.js test. Pay special attention to the final line, which 
returns the test suite in module.exports (this is a change from previous 
versions).

The proxy in testrunner.js expects the xTuple Node server to be running on 
port 9000 on localhost. If this is not true, modify the values in 
testrunner.js to point to the correct PROXY_HOST and PROXY_PORT.

To run all of the tests, type:

    node testrunner.js tests/*

You should see output that looks something like this:

    · ✓ OK » 1 honored (0.002s)

To run a specific test, just do:

    node testrunner.js tests/path/to/test.js
