To set up Vows.js testing, you need to install Node 0.6.5 or higher:

    http://nodejs.org/

This automatically includes npm, the Node Package Manager.

Next, install the following Node packages:

    sudo npm install -g vows jsdom xmlhttprequest

Vows.js tests are in the tests/ folder (client/tests/ in the Git repo). Take
a look at tests/example.js for how to code a Vows.js test. Pay special 
attention to the final line, which returns the test suite in module.exports 
(this is a change from previous versions).

Before you run your tests, you'll need to get the proxy server running. To do 
that, open aonther terminal window, cd to the client/ repository, and do:

    node proxy.js

Leave the proxy running indefinitely. The proxy expects the xTuple Node server
to be running on port 9000 on localhost. If this is not true, modify the 
values in proxy.js to point to the correct PROXY_HOST and PROXY_PORT.

To run all of the tests, type:

    node testrunner.js tests/*

You should see output that looks something like this:

    · ✓ OK » 1 honored (0.002s)

To run a specific test, just do:

    node testrunner.js tests/path/to/test.js
