To set up Vows.js testing, you need to install Node 0.6.5 or higher:

    http://nodejs.org/

This automatically includes npm, the Node Package Manager.

Next, install the following Node packages:

    sudo npm install -g vows jsdom xmlhttprequest

Vows.js tests are in the tests/ folder (client/tests/ in the Git repo). Take
a look at tests/example.js for how to code a Vows.js test with access to 
sproutnode and xt-core.

Before you run tests, you'll need to get the proxy server running. To do that,
open aonther terminal window, cd to the client/ directory, and do:

    node proxy.js

Leave the proxy running indefinitely. The proxy expects the xTuple Node server
to be running on port 8080 on localhost. If this is not true, modify the 
values in proxy.js to point to the correct PROXY_HOST and PROXY_PORT.

To run them, type:

    node testrunner.js tests/*

This will run vows with all tests. You should see output that looks something 
like this:

    ♢ Simple XM Core Tests
    
      XM's store
        ✓ is not null
        ✓ is of type SC.Store
        ✗ has datasource
          » expected 'XM.DataSource' to be of type 'object' // example.js:37
        ✗ with datasource of type XM.DataSource
          » expected 'XM.DataSource' to be a  // example.js:41
     
    ✗ Broken » 2 honored ∙ 2 broken (0.007s)

To run a specific test, do:

    node testrunner.js tests/path/to/test.js
