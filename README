This repository contains the database object definitions that enable a standard xTuple database to run in conjunction with the xTuple node based Datasource (https://github.com/xtuple/datasource).

Prerequisites:
 - Must have a running PostgreSQL server v8.4.0 or higher.
 - Must have a xTuple Postbooks or Commercial edition database installed v3.8.0 or higher.

Install node support on the database:

From the command line navigate to the postgresql directory, then run:

psql -d [your database] -U [your admin user] -f 'init_script.sql'
